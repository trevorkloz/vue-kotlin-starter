You will find two IDEA projects, frontend and backend. Please import them separately.

The frontend uses nodejs as application framework. To prepare and start the node server go to your terminal and run:
`npm install` followed by `npm run serve`. Alternatively use your IDEA integrations to build and start the project.

The backend is a spring boot application. Use gradle to startup the application ("bootRun").
